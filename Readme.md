# Crude Oil
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/crudeoil

## What's it do?
This is a VERY simple mod by design. All it does it add a fluid, Crude Oil, and adds potential underground deposit generation. Deposits only spawn in areas with deep sedimentary rock layers to keep with a little realism.

## Why?
I kept it simple so other mods can use the fluid for whatever they want. All they need to do is require this mod. Better to have one Crude Oil mod then 5 mods that add their own Crude Oil right?

## Fluid Amount for Modders
Okay, so a 'bucket' is a single block.
- 1 bucket = 1 block
- 1 block = 1 meter cubed
- 1 meter cubed = 1000 liters
- 1 bucket = 1000 liters

Enough of this millibucket nonsense please. A pump should have a minimum of 1000 liter internal tank capacity to handle a block of source liquid.

## TO DO LIST 
While simple, it isn't finished. If you think you can help, please consider a pull request.
- Bucket should clear source block. Might need to patch the bucket item code...
- Code for 'fountain' generation doesn't work. No experience with world-gen modding. Help would be appreciated. Currently the C# Code for the game doesn't run at all.

In the end I wanted a configurable/tunable mod that offers features such as surface deposits, different size underground deposits based on biome, and surface 'fountains' that have blocks down to large underground reservoirs. 

## Code
If you can help with any of the above, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request and I'll give credit without hesitation. Project is on-going but low-priority as it technically DOES work.
